			Approximately 10 million American households use online bill
			paying today, and the percentage is steadily increasing.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people don’t realize it, but not all of
			their ‘online’ payments are actually executed as electronic transactions.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, only the larger-volume payees are
			‘wired’ to electronically receive remittance advices and the electronic deposit
			of funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These large-volume payees
			account for roughly 70% of all recurring payments; the remaining 30% of
			payments which are initiated as online payments are actually executed as good
			ole paper checks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The online payment
			processors (companies such as <span class=SpellE>Checkfree</span>, <span
			class=SpellE>Metavante</span>, and others) have done a good job in ‘wiring’ the
			larger volume payees over the past 15 years, but they have largely reached a
			point of diminishing returns due to the expense involved in forging electronic
			payment connections and in maintaining those connections over time.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given the current delivery mechanisms, it
			just isn’t economically feasible to ‘wire up’ most low-volume payees.

			<dd><h3>Who are ‘low-volume payees’?</h3></dd>

			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>Low-volume payees are any entity that receives payments with
			some frequency on a recurring basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
			</span>Some examples of low-volume payees include doctors, dentists, churches,
			municipalities, small utilities and utility districts, and residential service
			providers such as lawn or pool maintenance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
			</span>In short, it is anyone that provides some service to a consumer which is
			not paid for at the time the service is rendered. </p>

			<div id="Payees"><dd><h3>Issues for the payees</h3></dd></div>

			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>The problems associated with receiving checks from online
			bill payers relates to the accuracy of the remittance information and the
			timeliness of funds availability. When
			an electronic payment processor generates a check on behalf of a consumer, the
			payee is deprived of any remittance advice that might normally accompany
			checks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some instances, the payee
			actually receives a single check in an aggregate amount together with a list of
			all of the accounts and the individual amounts that the check represents.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either way, receiving such a check represents
			a manual exception process in order to appropriately credit accounts with
			payments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In terms of funds availability,
			it may take several days for the checks to clear and for the funds to be
			available for use.</p>

			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>With RemitCenter, the funds are electronically deposited to an account you
			choose, at the bank of your choice.  With paper-based payments you receive a paper check, get it deposited,
			and possibly wait for the check to clear before the funds are made available. With RemitCenter
			the funds are available to you overnight.  This approach is also more secure, since checks
			can be stolen or mis-appropriated.  </p>
			
			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>At the same time the funds are depositied to your account, you will receive an email 
			notification that a deposit has been made.  The email will direct you to logon to your
			RemitCenter control console (an Internet browser application), where you can view and 
			download the remittance information associated with the payment.  Once downloaded, the 
			remittance information can be electronically imported into your accounts receivable package.

			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>The primary issue for the payer relates to mistakes made by
			payees in accurately posting payments to accounts.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As discussed above, payees usually go through
			a manual process to update accounts, and as with many manual processes mistakes
			are made.  With RemitCenter, your payments are made electronically to the payee, funds are 
			moved electronically, and remittance information is electronically available to the payee. </p>
			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>What do you need to do to send payments through RemitCenter?  Nothing!  If your payee is
			registered with RemitCenter, your payments will automatically be sent to the payee through the
			electronic payment network, without any action on your part.  If your payee enrolls at RemitCenter 
			you may notice that what was previously a "5 day merchant" now appears as a "2 day merchant", which 
			means that you now need to set-up payments to that payee two days in advance of the due date, rather
			than five days in advance.  That's it!	</p>
			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>Any payee who appears in your merchant list as a "5 day merchant" is eligible to participate
			in the RemitCenter payment network.  So if you have ever had problems with the posting of your online
			payments, or if you would like the flexibility of setting-up payments two days in advance instead of three, 
			please ask your payees to enroll at RemitCenter.

			<div id="Processors"><dd><h3>Issues for the payment processors</h3></dd></div>
			<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 40px"><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>Payment processors such as Checkfree, MasterCard, Online Resources and others have reached
			a point of diminishing returns to do the integration effort required to send electronic payments to 
			low volume payees.  The time and expense required to implement the electronic processes and maintain the 
			connections over time simply are not worth the value of reducing the small number of checks	sent to
			low volume payees.  RemitCenter offers an attractive alternative to paper checks; rather than the expense 
			of printing and mailing paper checks, the processor sends one aggregate file per day for all of the payees
			enrolled with RemitCenter.  From that perspective, RemitCenter is a payment consolidator for the low 
			volume payees.  In any perspective this approach represents reduced expense and smoother operation for the
			payment processors.

			Enrollment for RemitCenter is quick and secure.  You will need to provide your bank routing and transit
			number and your bank account number at that bank (both of which can be found on a check or a deposit slip, 
			so please have one handy when you start the enrollment process).  As a security measure and in order to ensure that you 
			are the actual account holder, your enrollment process will not be complete until we have deposited money to your 
			account and you have validated the amounts.<br><br>  

			When you register your U.S. bank account, RemitCenter makes two small deposits to your bank account, 
			each for an amount between $0.01 USD and $0.99 USD. These deposits should post to your bank account 
			within 2-3 business days. To find the amounts of the random deposits, you can look at your online 
			account statement or contact your bank's customer service department. <br><br>

			Once you know the amounts of the deposits, log in to your RemitCenter account and click the <b>Confirm Bank 
			Account</b> link on your Account Overview page to enter the amounts. If the amounts are correct, your 
			bank account will be confirmed and your enrollment will be complete.  <br><br>

			Within several days after your enrollment is complete, all payments being sent to you that used to arrive as 
			a check without the remittance advice (from companies such as Checkfree or Metavante or Online Resources) will
			now be directly depositied to your account.  You will also receive an email notification of the deposit(s), and
			you will be able to log in to your RemitCenter account to view and/or download the remittance information. </p>
